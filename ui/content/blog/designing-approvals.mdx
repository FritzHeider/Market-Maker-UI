Approvals are the connective tissue between automation and accountability. When they break, execution slows and risk compounds. When they are thoughtfully designed, **approvals enable your boldest moves**.

## Start with personas

Risk officers, traders, and legal stakeholders need different context. Map each persona to the metadata they require: historical performance, current exposure, or regulatory constraints. Market Maker lets you bind that metadata to the approval request so nobody is chasing screenshots.

## Timebox decisions

Dormant approvals are a hidden drag on liquidity. Introduce expirations, escalation paths, and auto-reassignment when someone is out of office. Transparency ensures nothing languishes.

## Instrument the flow

With event-level telemetry you can measure approval throughput, bottlenecks, and who is overburdened. The result is a resilient process that scales faster than headcount.
