Regulators no longer accept black boxes. They expect lineage, replay, and human accountability regardless of how much automation you deploy.

## Treat compliance as a product surface

Collect structured evidence – execution context, decision rationale, and reviewer notes – directly from the desk. Market Maker notarizes every state transition to make supervision painless.

## Standardize the narrative

Narratives build trust. Pair your quantitative evidence with a single-page explanation written for non-technical reviewers. When regulators can replay intent alongside impact, approvals accelerate.

## Iterate with your examiners

Bring regulators into the feedback loop. Share dashboards, deliver dry runs, and incorporate their requests into your playbooks. Collaboration beats confrontation.
